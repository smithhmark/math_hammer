## Purpose

To facilitate automated analysis of relative unit strengths.

## Goal

To allow a user to compare the relative expected damage of one model against another, based on a scenario.

Ideally:

 1. the rules for the attackers and defenders(in terms of the probability impacts) exist in extensible libraries
 1. the rules can be looked up based on the keywords
 1. the impact of things like cover can be automatically handled based on the 'situation'

## Approach

One way units are compared is to compare how many wounds/damage/casualties are expected from a single model attacking a single model.

Also of interest, is parameterizing the above by range bands.
